Adds a custom "table of contents" Gutenberg block.

== Description ==

It works by parsing the post content and retrieving the heading blocks,
and creates a new dynamic block with a list of links to the headings.

No customizations. No options. Just an unordered list. Because of that SimpleTOC is
compatible with AMP and is automatically SEO optimized.
