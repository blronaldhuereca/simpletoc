SEO-friendly Table of Contents Gutenberg block. No JavaScript and no CSS means faster loading.

== Description ==

Add a Table of Contents block to your posts and pages. The TOC is a nested list of links to all heading found in the post or page. To use it, simply add a block and search for "SimpleTOC" or just "TOC". 

The maximum depth of the toc can be configured in in the blocks' sidebar among many other options. There can hide the headline "Table of Contents" and add your own by using a normal heading block.  

SimpleTOC is open-source and developed on [GitHub Pages](https://github.com/mtoensing/SimpleTOC). If you find a bug or have an idea for a feature please feel free to contribute and create a pull request.

== Installation ==

SimpleTOC can be found and installed via the Plugin menu within WordPress administration (Plugins -> Add New). Alternatively, it can be downloaded from WordPress.org and installed manually...

In Gutenberg, add a block and search for "SimpleTOC" or just "TOC". Please save your content before you use the block.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= How do I add a background color to SimpleTOC using Gutenberg groups? =

Select the block and select "group" in the context menu. Apply "background color", "link color" and "text color" to this group. SimpleTOC will inherit these styles. You would like to use this styled SimpleTOC group next time you write a post? Convert it to a reusable block.

= How do I add smooth scrolling? =

You can optionally add the css class "smooth-scroll" to each link the TOC. Then you can install plugin that uses these classes.

= How do I hide a single heading? = 

If you really want to hide a single heading from the table of contents then add the CSS class "simpletoc-hidden" to a heading block. But first of all, think about the reason you want to hide a specific heading. Maybe you want to remove all headins of a specific depth level. Then there is an option for that in the blocks options in Gutenberg. If you think this heading should not be part of the toc maybe it is not needed in the post itself?

= How do I add SimpleTOC to all articles automatically?  =

I don’t see an easy solution at the moment. SimpleTOC is only a block that can be placed in your post. If there would be a plugin that adds blocks to every post then this would be the solution. I think this should be another separate plug-in to keep the code of SimpleTOC clean and … well, simple. Maybe someone knows of a plug-in that adds blocks automatically to all posts with some parameters and settings? What about site editing in WordPress? I think the core team is working on something like that. I will keep this post open. If I have gained more knowledge how to solve this I will add this feature. 

= How to allow developers to exclude specific blocks? = 

Use the 'simpletoc_excluded_blocks' filter. For example, this code will exclude header blocks that are inside a column block:

    ‘add_filter( 'simpletoc_excluded_blocks', function ( array $blocks ) {
        $blocks[] = 'core/column';

        return $blocks;
    } );‘
