Adds a custom "table of contents" Gutenberg block.

== Description ==

In Gutenberg, add a block and search for "SimpleTOC" or just "TOC". You need to save your post before you add the block. It works by parsing the post content and retrieving the heading blocks and creates a new dynamic block with a list of links to the headings.

* Designed for Gutenberg.
* Compatible with AMP plugins.
* Minimal and valid HTML output.
* Inherits the style of your theme.
* No customizations needed.
* SEO friendly.
* No javascript or css added.
* Comes with English, French, Spanish and German translations.

This plugin is forked from https://github.com/pdewouters/gutentoc by pdewouters and uses code from https://github.com/shazahm1/Easy-Table-of-Contents by shazahm1
